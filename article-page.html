                <div>
                  <h4> Intro (h4)</h4>
                  <p>Cheese boards, like most things in this life, come in different tiers of quality. You may have picked at the bright orange and white rectangles of a prepackaged Sam's Club cheddar cheese platter at your office holiday party or maybe you’ve splurged before the main course at that restaurant with the bonkers ambiance and ordered the cheese plate, not understanding a word as you nod along to the waiters description of the varieties and origins of all the boards contents. Whatever your level of experience, quality cheese plates are deceptively easy to create and you’ll be able to enjoy that ambiance tier cheese at a fraction of the price. All you need is a board, some knives, and the desire to delve into the smelly world of cheese.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h4> Get the Gerl!?</h4>
                  <p> You know what? I’m just gonna go right out and say it. Cheese boards don't have to be on a wooden board or a sheet of slate. It’s cool if you do have a giant fancy cutting board. But if you don’t, no need to fear, use one of your aluminum sheet plans or a large dinner plate. Same thing goes for cheese knives. If you dont got em, just use your butter knives. If you've got something large and flat to put cheese on and a knife from your kitchen that's really all you need.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <h4>The Cheese Shop</h4>
                  <p>Your first step in becoming Master of Funk is to know where to find the cheese. Your best bet for quality and variety would be to find your local cheese and wine shop. At these counters they will typically cut cheese to order so you’ll be snacking while you shop. These places also typically have knowledgeable cheesemongers, but don’t be scared, you’ll want to become fast friends and use <span class="inline-link">their knowledge to find affordable quality cuts </span>  and local favorites.</p>

                    <h4> The Grocery Store</h4>
                    <p> If you don’t have a cheese shop near you, your next best bet would be the good ol grocery store. You know your local grocery stores better than we do, but one thing that is usually constant, groceries have two different cheese sections. Follow your nose past the prepackaged deli slices and park your cart in front of what is hopefully a goldmine of wheels, logs, and blocks. Groceries are a different game when compared to those dedicated cheese shops. Most times, you’ll find cheese precut and packaged and more likely than not you won't have one of those cheese experts there to walk you through the products. But fear not, we are talking all about cheese basics next!</p>
                  
                    <h5>Tips to make the most of your trip when you don’t have chessemonger handy:</h5>
                  <ol>
                    <li>If you are finding the pieces to be large for your needs, ask to have them cut down to your desired size by a deli employee.</li>
                    <li>Look for the odds and ends bucket where the small pieces get chucked. This is a great way to try out new cheeses without having to purchase large pieces you may not enjoy. </li>
                  </ol>

                      <h4> The Triforce Assembles</h4>
                      <p>So you’ve familiarized yourself with the cheese case but now you want to know which cheeses to select. We have a foolproof method for building the perfect board. For a cheese plate that is visually, texturally, and tastefully balanced you will want to find one of each of the following three categories; </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li> Soft Cheese</li>
                        <li> Hard Aged Cheese</li>
                        <li> Cheddar</li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>  

                <div>
                  <h6> Soft Cheeses</h6>
                  <p>Come in a variety of styles, most commonly bries and camemberts. These will have white rinds and a soft center. They are soft because they are generally aged for a short period of time and white because they have a white mold growing on the exterior of the cheese which imparts it with flavor. (Local - Bent River Camembert) (Big Hitter - )</p>
                  <h6> Hard Aged Cheeses</h6>
                  <p>Come in a large variety of colors, milk sources, geographic regions, and lengths of aging. Goudas, Gruyeres, Manchegos and Garrotxa style goat cheese are good examples. The longer your cheese is aged the less moisture the cheese will contain, the harder the cheese will become. (Local - ) (Big Hitter - 5 Year Gouda)</p>
                  <h6> Cheddars</h6>
                  <p>Typically also aged and hard, but have a distinct flavor giving them their own spot on the board. They are also the perfect springboard for cheese beginners. Most aged cheddars are between 9 months and 15 years but you’ll do well with a 2 year aged cheddar to start. As hard cheeses age, they begin to develop crystals within the cheese. We could explain the science but all you really need to know is crystals in hard cheeses equals YUM! (Local - Prairie Breeze) (Big Hitter - )</p>
                </div>

                  <h4>Next Level Funk</h4>
                  <p>Have you been waiting for us to bring up the dark horses of the cheese world, those cheeses that some say smell of feet? Then this is the section for you. For the more adventurous crowd we recommend adding a Washed-Rind Cheese or a Blue to your board as an extra 4th cheese.</p>
                  <h6> Washed-Rind-Cheeses</h6>
                  <p>are typically washed (duh) with saltwater, wine, or beer. This process kills off unwanted mold and promotes the growth of a tasty bacteria that helps give these cheeses their interesting flavors and more interesting smells. Tellegio is the one of the most common wash rind cheeses and good for both cooking and eating.
                  </p>
                  <h6> Blue Cheeses</h6>
                  <p>are (in my opinion) misunderstood. Most associate blue cheese with  the crumbly bits on undesirable salads. But, Iconic blues like the Stilton from England or St. Peet’s Blue from Minnesota are must tries for those interested in understanding why there is so much to love about the funk. Blue cheese, unlike other cheeses, have the desired culture (blue stuff) added to the milk while the cheese is being formed. Resulting in the veiny blue emanating from the center of these cheeses. When I add a blue to a cheese board I’m bringing to a dinner party and I hear the disgusted comments when other guests see those blue veins, all I do is smile, cause rest assured there will be more for me.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Have 4 oz of cheese per person</li>
                    <li>Don’t have more types of cheese than guests </li>
                  </ol>
                </div>

                    <h4>The Do’s and Dont’s of finishing Touces</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li> From a simple weeknight dinner for two, to a modest bounty of cheese, nuts, and fruit for that dinner party next weekend, cheese plates can easily scale to the situation at hand. Whatever the size of the board, we need to make sure it looks like a showstopper when complete. These Do’s and Don'ts should help you bring your plate past the finish line to mouth watering applause. </li>
                        <li> Don’t forget the toasted bread. Cut a loaf of French bread at a 45 into thin ovals and toss in olive oil on a sheet pan. Broil till just golden on the outside with a bit of chew at the center.</li>
                        <li> Do go to your groceries olive bar, sample each kind of olive, then purchase a small container of your fave for your cheese board.</li>
                        <li>Don’t be afraid to look like a total nerd when you label all of the cheeses with toothpicks and name flags.</li>
                        <li>Do upgrade your nut game from almonds to Marcona Almonds (AKA Fancy Ass Almonds) if you’re just that extra. Toss in olive oil, salt, and some aromatic herbs like rosemary and thyme then toast to perfection before plating.</li>
                        <li>Don’t overdo it on the non edible garnishes. Try to stick to placing things on your board you intend people to eat. But if you must shove a sprig of thyme between the crackers and manchego I can't physically stop you.</li>
                        <li>Do shake your apple slices in 50/50 fresh lemon juice and water to preserve their youthful looks. Bonus, just before serving remove almost all the juice from the bag and toss them with a tablespoon of honey.</li>
                        <li>Don’t add the crackers till the last minute they may get a little moist.</li>
